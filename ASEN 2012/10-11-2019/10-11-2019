  Trapezoid Rule (try trapz)
  Simpson's Rule
  Initial value problem

  vout = alpha * h
    where alpha = 1.5e6 ft^2 / day
    vin = 2e^7 ft^3 /day

    use delta t = 7 days, 4 days, 1 day, and 0.5 days

    find if it stabilizes

    [v, dVdh] = get_Volume(h,L)
    h(t=0) = 20ft

    Does h stabilize, if so , at what value?
    which delta t value leads the most accurate result.
