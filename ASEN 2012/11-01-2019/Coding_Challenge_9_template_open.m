% CODE CHALLENGE 9 - Open Template Script
%
% The purpose of this challenge is to predict whether or not the Boulder
% Reservior will have to close due to a major leak.
%
% To complete the challenge, execute the following steps:
% 1) Set an initial condition velocity
% 2) Set values for constants
% 3) Propagate freefall w/ drag for 20 seconds
% 4) Plot the velocity vs. time
% 5) Calculate the change kinetic energy vs. time
% 6) Plot the change in kinetic energy vs. time
%
% NOTE: DO NOT change any variable names already present in the code.
% 
% Upload your team's script to Canvas to complete the challenge.
