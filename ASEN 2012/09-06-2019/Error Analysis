Error Analysis: Part 1

Error
  Random
    Statistical Fluctuations
    Either Direction (+ or -)
    - > Precision (Archer Analogy)

    Inevitable
    Comes From:
      Statistical Estimates
        Parameter itself
        Uncertainty associated with it
      Many Measurements

  Systematic
    Reproducible Inaccuracy
    Same Direction (Bias)
    - > Accuracy (Archer Analogy)

    Difficult to detect
    Comes From:
      Equipment
      Improper tools to make measurements
      Error you make

Measurements
  Mean - Average, best estimate of parameter
    x - Notation for measurment
    x (With a bar over it) = sigma x (sub i) / N
      i represents each replicate
      N represents total # of measurements taken

  Standard Deviation - Best estimate of uncertainty in measurement
    (How much variation is in data)
    "sigma of x" = sqrt( (1/(N-1)) sigma(x sub i - x bar)^2 )
                Bias Reduction ^        ^ Root Mean Square

Example
  Period of Oscillation of a Pendulum
    Trial #  |   1   |   3   |   3   |   4   |   5   |
    Measured |  3.9  |  3.5  |  3.7  |  3.4  |  3.5  |


    Xbar = Sigma x sub \ N = ( 3.9 + 3.5 + 3.7 + 3.4 + 3.5 ) / 5
    Xbar = 3.6 sec

    Trial #   |   1   |   3   |   3   |   4   |   5   |
    Xi - Xbar |  0.3  | -0.1  |  0.1  | -0.2  | -0.1  |

    N = 5

    "sigma of x" = sqrt((1/4) * 0.16) = 0.2
