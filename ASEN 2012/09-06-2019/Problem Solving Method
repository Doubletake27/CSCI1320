Ten Steps
  1)  Understand the Purpose of the problem
  2)  Collect the information you know
  3)  Determine what you are required to find
  4)  Simplify the problem by making appropriate assumptions
  5)  Draw a sketch of the problem and label any necessary variables
  6)  Determine which fundamental principles can be applied to the problem
  7)  Consider alternate approaches that may also be applied before deciding on how to proceed
  8)  Develop a step-by-step process to solve the problem
  9)  If you are using a computer program, you should check if it functions properly with hand calculations and/or simpler versions of the problem
  10) Perform a "reality check" on the solution (i.e. does the solution make sense?)

Bisection Method for Root Finding
  1) Purpose: Locate the Root of a Line
  2) Given:
     Equation of the Line
     Starting interval values
  3) Find: x value for which y = 0
  4) Assume:
     There is only 1 root
     You need to be within a precision of 0.1x
     The line is continuous
  5) Sketch a rough idea of the line
  6) Equations / Fundamental Principles
     If a line is continuous with only one root and
        two x values both return positive y values
          Then the root does not lie between them
        two x values both return negative y values
          Then the root does not lie between them
        two x values return a negative and a positive y value
          Then the root DOES lie between them
  7) You could also set the equation equal to 0 and solve
  8) Starting with the end points as points A and B
      Find the x midpoint (m)
      Determine the corresponding y the value of the midpoint
      If the y value has the same sign as Point B
        Replace B with m and repeat
      If the y value has the opposite sign as Point B
        Replace A with m and repeat
      Else if the y value is 0
        You are done
  9) Plug in your final answer to the equation by hand to verify it was correct
  10) Does the solution fall between starting points A and B?
