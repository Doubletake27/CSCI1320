Calorimeter
  A device used to determine the specific heat capacity of a material.
  Uses the 1st law of Thermodynamics applied to an isolate system

Specific heat capacity
  The amount of energy needed to raise a unit mass of a material by
  one unit of temperature

In the isolate system
  Delta U = 0
  U2 - U1 = 0

  (Mc*Uc2 + Ms*Us2) - (Mc*Uc1 + Ms*Us1) = 0
    Mc = Mass calorimeter
    Ms = Mass of Sample

    U = cT = Specific Heat * Temperature

    Cs = (Mc Cc (T2 - T0) )/(Ms (T1-T2 ))

    Linear fit initial data up to when hot sample is added to generate initial temp
      least squares line

    Fit a line to the Average of Th and TL and advance upward

    Monte carlo error simulation?
