Function Calls and the Stack pointer

Call Stack
  Before each jump to the function code
    store the return address in special memory location

    %rsp    - Register Stack Pointer
    Stores the pointer to the top of the stack

    Before each function Call
      push parameters onto stack
      push return address onto the stack
      push / allocate local variables on the stack
