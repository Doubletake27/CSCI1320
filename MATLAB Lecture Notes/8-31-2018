MATLAB Introduction
  Environment
  Variables
  Assignment Statements

MATLAB - Matrix Laboratories
  Created by Mathematicians
  IDE - Integrated Development Environment
  High Level Language
    Requires an interpreter
    Not complied like C++
  Optimized for matrix Math
  Tons of built-in functions and Toolboxes
    Simulink, Image processing....

  Can be used interactively
    >>>
    Enter commands at prompt
    MATLAB will respond with a result
    Big Fancy Calculator

  Can be used as a scripted Language
