 Quiz 2 - posted Today, due Monday

 Today
   Pointers - to non-native data types (user defined)

   Memory Allocation
     Call stack vs heap
     Automatic(local) vs dynamic variables

 User Defined Types
   -Pointer to a structs

   eg.

  struct Person{
    string name;
    int age;
  }

  Person p1; // instance of person
  Person *ptr; // pointer to a Person type
  ptr = &p1; // pointer to address of p1

  // syntax for accessing members of struct via pointer

    (*ptr).name = "Alaba" // Will access the name member of Person p1
    (*ptr).age = 27; // Accesses the age member of Person p1
s
      // Alternatively

    ptr -> name = "Alaba"; // Exact same as above
    ptr -> age = 27;

      // Can be used inside a cout

    cout << ptr->name << endl;

Dynamically Allocated
  Automatic variables get allocated on the stack
  Automatic because the memory is automatically allocated

  Dynamically allocated variables get allocated at run-time and use the heap (free-store)

    "new" and " delete"

  Have to use a pointer to allocated memory Dynamically

    int *p1; // declare a Pointer
    p1 = new int; // Grabs new memory from the heap and allocates enough of it to store an int;
                  // new int is accessed through pointer exclusively
                  // nameless variable

    // Must also manually de-allocate memory
    delete p1; // Frees up the memory
    p1 = null; // Prevents you from accidentally accessing the no longer allocated space again;

  Dynamically Allocated Array
    eg length 5

    int n;
    int *ptr;
    n = 5;
    ptr = new int[n];
    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
      cin >> ptr[i];
    }

    delete [] ptr;  // deallocate entire array
                    // No need to pass the length

  Array Doubling Example
    1) create N-length dynamic array
    2) read in N values to fill array
    3) "double" the array length, keeping the first N elements in place.

  Approach
    1) Declare N-length dynamic Array
    2) Fill array
    3) Create a new array of 2N length
    4) copy over values from 1st array to 2nd Array

      a->   [     ]N
             |||||
      temp->[          ]2N

    5) Clean up
      a) free up memory of "a"
      b) make "a" point to the same address as "temp"
      c) temp = NULL;
