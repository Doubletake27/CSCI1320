Dijkstra's Algorithm
  finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph

  1) mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes
  2) Mark infinite distance to each node
  3) Consider all of current node's unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node, update them if they are smaller
  4) After considering all neighbors of current node, mark it visited
  5) If destination node has been marked visited or smallest distance among unvisited nodes is infinity, stop.
  6) Otherwise, select unvisited node with smallest distance, set as current node and go back to step 3

  infinity:
    #include <climits>
      INT_MAX
