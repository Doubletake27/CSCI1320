Hash Table
  Hash table is a data structure that uses mapping to assign a "record" to a unique index of an array
  Say, you want to store the name and SID of a group of students

  Key: name
  value: SID

  hashFunction("Anna") -> generates unique index -> 2
              ("Bryan") -> 1
  Two components:
    1. array for storing records
    2. hash function for generating the unique code for a Key
        hash function is repeatable
          hash ("Billy") -> 7
          will always get a 7
        hash is used as array index

    Hash Functions ( Hashing a key that is string type)
      One of the simplest:
        sum values in a string
        then mod(%) by array length

      hashSum(key, keyLength, table size){
        sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < keyLength; i++){
          sum += key[i];
        }
        return (sum%tableSize);
      }

    Store Records in a hash table
      Calculate Index Value (hash the key)
      Write the data to hash table at the index

    Retrieve Records
      use search key to calculate index

    What is the cost of store / retrive  - > O(1)

Each array location can only store a single record but if there are two trying to occupy one location
  n(k1) = n(k2)
