HEaps
  Less organized tree basically

  int extractMin()
    if(currentSize <= 0)
      return error
    if(current size == 1)
      return heap[0]
      current size --
    x = heap[0]
    move the last element of array into root position
    call minHeapify (0)
    return x

  void minHeapify(int i)
    //recursively heapify tree
    1) Check which child is smallest, then swap with that child
        need to ensure that child is valid
          use current size
    2) if swap was preformed, call minheapify with index of element that was swapped
