BFT Example

  LEts build the following graph then traverse it in breadth first order

  update the vertex struct definition to include boolean "visited " member and integer "distance" member.

    struct vertex{
      std::string name;
      bool visited;
      int distance;
      std::vector<adjVertex> adj;
    }


Depth First Traverse
  Specify a starting vertex
  keep visiting the first non-visited vertex in each adjacency list
  Once adj list with 0 non-visited vertices is encountered, go back to last intersection and visit next vertex in adjacency list

    depthFirstTraverse(value)
      root = find(value);
      disp(vertex key)
      depthFirstRecursive(root)

    depthFirstRecursive(vertex)
      vertex.visited = true;
      loop accross adjacency list of vertex
        if(adj vertex NOT visited)
          disp(adj vertex key)
          depthFirstRecursive(x)
