Problem 3 Explanation

  Definitely would have written the driver with loops and user inputs if I had more time

  This program was built off of what I previously had built for graphs
  Compilation instructions are in the output.txt file 

I apologize for the lack of user inputs however the problem instructions do not call for them
  so I saw no reason to add them.
If for some reason you wish to test out different values, it should be fairly straight forward to edit the driver function
