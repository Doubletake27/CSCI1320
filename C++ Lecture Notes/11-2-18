Functions in C++ can ether return a value or not
  Only one variable can be returned by a c++ function.
  A function that returns nothing is called a void function.
  A function can take in any number or variables of any type

  result = pow(x,y); // returns a double type
  result = abs(x); // returns int type

  Pre- defined functions
    sqrt
    pow
    abs
    labs
    fabs
    ceil
    floor
    exit
    rand
    srand

  Write a program that generates a dozen random integers between 0 and 3
    Pre-defined function rand() generates rand integers
    rand() outputs a random number b/w 0 and some large constant
    How do we control the range?
    rand() outputs a value b/w 0 and (say... 20)
      [20,11,3,0]
      20/3 = 6, 11/3 = 3, 3/3 = 1, 17/3 = 5, 0/3 = 0
      Modulo
      20%3 = 2, 11%3 = 2, 3%3 = 0, 17%3 = 2, 0%3 = 0
      d = 3
      min possible output = 0
      max possible output = 2
    Algorithm
      max range value d = 3;
      rand()modulo(n+1)
      repeat step 2 a dozen times
  randGen.cpp

      //cout << time(NULL) << " seconds has passed since 00:00:00 GMT, Jan 1 1970" << endl;
