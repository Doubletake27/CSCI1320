C++ is an object oriented language with classes in objects
  different from C

Compiler turns source code into executable
We will have to learn command line
  Compile C++ Programs
  Run compiled Programs
  Delete / move / create / rename files and directories

Use windows powershell
mkdir

cd
  changes directory
cd..
  backs out of directory
touch
  create a new file
ls

rm
  delete files
rm -r-
  remove directory
g++
  compile c++
.out / .exe

---------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  // this is how we comment in C++
  count << "Hello World!" << endl;
  return 0;
}

# include - indicates libraries to be included in the program
'#' indicates pre-processor directive
io stream - in put/output streaming
using namespace - tells the compiler to use standard set of symbols
