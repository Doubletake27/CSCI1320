Pass By Value
  Address does not get passed, merely the value of the variable.
  Function does not alter the caller's variable.

  void foo(int myArray);

Pass By Reference
  Address IS passed
  Function can alter caller's variable

  void foo (int &myArray)

Pass By Array
  Address of first element is passed
  You should actually also pass in the size

  void foo(int myArray[], int size)

String variable types
  Include string library to allow for string variables
  When we declare a variable of string type, we are actually instantiating an object of the string class

Objects, unlike primitive types (int, double, char, ...)
  can have functions associated with them
  Called member functions (or methods)

string class in pratice
  string str1, str2; //
  str1 = str2; // assigns value of str2 to str1
  str1 < str2; // Lexicographic comparison (alphabetical)
  str1.length() // Returns the number of characters in the string
  str1.empty() // Returns a Boolean true if string is empty

Reading files in C++
  #include <fstream> //   We use something called a stream object
  ifstream inputStream; //   Declare objects of the if stream class
  inputStream.open("filename.txt"); // Connecting an external file
  string myVar; // Create some form of variable to store data into, in this case string
  inputStream >> myVar; // Stores values from inputStream into myVar
  // Uses white space delimiters, incrementing
  outputStream.close();
