Todays Objectives
  variables
  Constants
  assignment short-hands
  string class
  typecasting

Declaring Variables is require in C++
  int x; <- Declaration
    variable will be initialized
  x = 3; <- Initialization
    if not initialized, unpredictable behavior
  -------------
  can be combined into one step
    int x = 3;
  ---------
  also can make a variable a Constants
    const int x = 12

    with const, must initialize when declaring
    a const cannot be written to except for during initialization.
    typically used for a value that we know should stay constant during program execution
  ------
Shorthand Operators
  ++ increment by 1
  -- decreent by 1
  += increment by some value
  -= decrement by some values
  /= divide by some value
  %=
---
Pre and Post increments
  int x, y = 3;
  x = 2 * (y++);

    2 multiplies the value stored in y and assigns the result to x
    then y gets incremented

  int x, y = 3;
  x = 2 * (++y)
    y gets incremented (before it gets used)
    2 multiplies y (which has been incremented)

Variable types
  short
  int
  long
  float
  double
  long double
  char
  bool

String Class
  No primitive type for storing multiple characters
    #include <string>
    string myWord;
    myWord = "hello"

Type typecasting
  double x;
  x = 1/2; // what will be written to x?
  // results in 0 because 1 and 2 are integers

  when we write "w" the compiler interprets it as an int type
  integer divided by integer results in division but only keeping the integer part.

Two Ways to cast: implicit, explicit
  // Implicit
  double x;
  x = 1.0 / 2;
  or
  x = 1 / 2.0;
  or
  x = 1.0 / 2.0;

  // Explicit
  double x;
  x = double(1)/2;
    returns 0.5
  x = double(1/2)
    returns 0 still
  ________________
  double x = 3;
  x = int(x); // what will this result in?

  CANNOT REDECLARE DATA TYPE
