// Class Review
  // Classes are important

// ----
class Student
{
public:
  void setIdNumber(int x){
    idNumber = x;
  }
private:
  int idNumber;
}

int main(){
  Student s1;
  s1.setIdNumber(69420);
  return 0;
}
// ----
// The only way to access member data is to go through a member function
// Function can have various fail-safes built in

// --- Mutator Example
  void setIdNumber(int x){
    id(x<0)
      idnumber = x;
    else
      cout << "Your are a terrible person and ID must be positive" << endl;
  }
// Very commmon type of member Function
  // called a mutator or setter function
  // can be used outside of the Class
  // can be reused within the Class

// What if we want to readx private data?
  // cannot read private data directly
  // need an accessor function
  int getData(){
    return idNumber;
  }


// Class Sandbox.cpp
// timeEg.cpp

// The Constructor
  // A special kind of member function that is called every time a new object is created
  // Allocates the space for all member variables
  // Can be user defined to take in arguments
  // gets the same name as the class
  // Doesnt have a varialbe type

  class Time12{
    public:
      Time12(){
        hour = 12;
        minute = 59;
        mer = "AM"
      }
  }
