Type Casting is important

Input using cin
  cin >> num;
  waits for the user to enter value
  once user hits enter, value gets assigned to variable (num)
  >>  Points where the data flows

Example: calculate dog age in human years
  #include <iostream>
  #include <string> // allows us to use strings
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
    string dogName;
    const double D2H_FACTOR = 7.4;
    int actualAge;
    double humanAge;

    cout << "How many years old is your dog? " << endl;
    cin >> actualAge;
    humanAge = actualAge*D2D2H_FACTOR;

    cout << "What is you dog's name? "
    cin >> dogName;

    cout << dogName << "'s age is approximately equivalent to a " << humanAge << year old human." << endl;

    return 0;
  }

Relational Expressions
  Equal to ==
  Not Equal !=  *** different than matlab ***
  less than <
  Greater than >
  less than or equal to <=
  greater than or equal to >=

  Just like MATLAB, the result is binary (0 or 1, False or True)
    type boolean

  ! NOT
  && AND
  || OR

Branching: if, if-else, if-else if, else statements

if(Boolean_Expression){
  statement 1;
  statement 2;
} else if {
statement 3;
} else {
  more statements;
}

curly braces only needed if two or lines of code happen within each statement
