Tic-Toc
  Time your code

Recap For Loops

Tic - Starts the Stop Watch
Toc - Reads the time from the stop watch.

Engineering notation is valid (1e6)

Growing a vector
  for i = i:3
    vec(i) = i^2;
  end

  Better - Reallocate memory

  N = 3;
  vec = zeros(1,N);
  for i = 1:N
    vec(i) = i^2;
  end

While Loops
  While Condition
    action
  end
