What is CS?
  Telling the computer what you want it to do
  Designing algorithms inputs to outputs
  The study of the fundamental functions of a computer
  Trys to understand computers? / programs
    Computers are mostly understood by now

  Roots:
    Cognitive Science
    Math
    Engineering

"Computers are to CS are what telescopes are to astronomy" - E Dijkstra

What is a program?
  Sequence of instructions: tell a computer what to do
    List of specific instructions for preforming a specific task
    Need to be written a language that is understood by computers
    Unambiguous
    Terminating

    Must Haves:
      Execute statements sequentially, in the order written by the programmer
      Branching options based on decisions
        IF, ELIF, SWITCH
      Repeat a chunk of statements
        FOR, WHILE

What is a programing language
  Exact and Unambiguous
  Precise Form (Syntax)

  High-Level Languages
    have English like commands
    Portable
    C, C++, Java, Python, Pearl, PHP, MATLAB

  Low-Level Languages
    Written for particular machine processer
    Not very Portable
    Not great for reading for humans
    Typically what happens after high level is compiled.

Approach to writing a computer program
  Analyze the Problem:
    What will it do?
  Determine specifications
    What will it accomplish
    Inputs / Outputs & how will they relate
  Created Design
    algorithm
    Ordered instructions
    Needs to meet specs
  Implement Design
    Translate into programing Language
  Test and Debug Program
    Fix Errors
