  MATLAB Debugger
  While Loop
  Nested Loops

Debugging in MATLAB
  A bug can cause an incorrect result or can cause an error
  Sometimes it is useful to know variable values at specific locations in program execution.

  Can USE MATLAB debugger to "step through code"

  Place a "Breakpoint" to indicate where to halt the program execution

  Basically click on the side of the code.

  Mess around with breakpoints and stepping


%% Sections code into something called a live script - can start runningit from that line

While Loops
  while true
    do
  end

  %Scripty Example

  number = input('Enter positive number ')
  while number < 0
    number = input('entered number not positive, enter positive number ');
  end
  %continues on with the program

  %calculate the sine of a user input value
  clear
  clc
  angle = input('Enter angle in degrees')
  count = 0;

  %% Calculate the sine of a user input

  while angle ~= -1
    fprintf('Sine of %.2 is %.2f\n',angle,sind(angle))
    angle = input('Enter Angle in Degrees (-1 to exit) ');
    count = count + 1;
  end

  fprintf('Thank you for your %d times patronage',count)
