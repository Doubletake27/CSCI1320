Recap:
  Relational Expressions
  Logical Expressions
  Scripts

Question from Quiz 1
  3 < x < 7
    Math: States that x is greater than 3 and less than 7
    MATLAB: 3 < x : can be 0 or 1
            Due to comparison will cast to double datatype
            0 or 1 < 7 : 1 (True)
    Essentially checks whether x is less than 3,
      Then compares the value of the result to check if less than 7

Logical Expressions
  a||b OR
  a&&b AND
  ~a NOT
  XOR(a,b) XOR

Truth Tables are used to list outputs given all possible combinations of inputs.

Scripts
  Stored with .m extension
  Click "New Script" under the HOME tab; this opens the editor
  save by giving it a meaningful Name
  Execute by entering name into prompt
  >> tempCheck
  Don't need extension
  Can also hit Green Play Button

Temp Check Problem:
  Psudeocode
    1) Set current temp to 150
        currentTemp = 150;
    2) Set target temp to 151
        targetTemp = 151;
    3) Set max temp to 160
        maxTemp = 160;
    4) Check if currentTemp is equal to target temp, write result to VAR A
        A = currentTemp == targetTemp
    5) Check if currentTemp is less than max temp, write result to VAR B
        B = currentTemp < maxTemp
    6) Write true to isTarget if Var A and B are both true
        isTarget = (A==1)&&(B==1)

Program Inputs
  The input() function does two things
    1)
    2)
  General form for reading in a number:
    >> variableName = input('prompt string')
  Always used in assignment Statement
  Takes a string as input argument

Replace hardcoded currentTemp value with user input.

Display functions
  disp('hello')
  or
  varA = 'hello';
  disp(varA)

  Not used in assignment statements

  fprintf()
    Allows for more Statements

  stu=396;
  fprintf('There are %d students \n',stu)

  Pass in variable that stores value
  Escape Sequence + variable


  %d integer
  %f float (real numbers)
  %c character (one character)
  %s string of character
  \n new line

User-Defined functions
  Specialized code module
    input, do something, output
  stored in m-file (like script)
    gets its own file
    looks different inside that file
  behaves just like built-in functions
    call the function by using its Name
    pass arguments
    functions returns the result

  Scripts dont return results, functions do
