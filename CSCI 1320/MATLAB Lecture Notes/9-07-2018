Recap:
  Types
  Relational Expressions

New:
  Logical Expressions
  Scripts

Types:
  Single/double; Real Numbers
  Char: Vector of Characters
    Use single quotes to define
  String: Series of Letters of word
    Use double quotes to define
  Logical: True/False (1/0)
  Integer Types: Int8, int16,int32,int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
    int8, etc...
      signed integers (+/-)
      listed with how many bits
    uint8, etc...
      unsigned integer (+ only, 0 ok)

  Default type: double

  Improve performance by efficiently selecting datatype

Relational Expressions:
  > Greater than
  < Less than
  >= greater than or equals
  <= less than or equals
  == equality
  ~= inequality

Useful commands
  clear - Clears variables
  clc - clears command window (not variables though)
  close all - closes all windows (graphing and otherwise)
  Up arrow - recalls commands
  ; at end of command - suppresses output

Logical Expressions
  a || b - OR statement, true if a or b is true
  a && b - AND statement, true if a and b are both True
  ~a - NOT statement, returns opposite value
  xor(a,b) - exclusive or, returns true iff a or b is true, not both
    This is actually a function

  Truth tables - yay!

Variable Names
  Can seperate by underscore
    var_1 is valid
  Cannot place number infront of letters
    2var is not valid
  Cannot get around by using _
    3_var is not valid
  letters following is ok
    var4 is valid
  Can mix letters and numbers, starting with letters
    var5test is valid

Scripts
  Files have .m extension
  Name Scripts meaningfully
    probably camel case
  Execute script by entering name into the command prompt
  Script file must be in CurrentFolder
  % is comment

Random numbers
  Section in textbook chapter 1
  variable = rand;
    creates random value between 0 and 0 and 1
  randi([])
