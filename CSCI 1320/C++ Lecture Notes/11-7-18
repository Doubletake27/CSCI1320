Write a program for the user to guess a number between 1 and 20
count number of tries

see program guessGame.cpp

Variable scope is a thing
local variables cannot be used across functions

Variables live in the memory
  each variable has a place in the moemory
  each memory has a location called a pointer

  use the & symbol to get addresses

--- AddressSandbox.cpp ----------
#include <iostream>
using namespaces std;

int main(){
  int x = 3;
  cout << "x" = << x << endl;
  cout << "address of x = " << &x << endl;

  return 0;
}
