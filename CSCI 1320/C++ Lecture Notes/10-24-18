Extra Quiz 6 Due Friday (MATLAB)
Go figure out office hours to argue grade on practicum

Scripting language
  Can execute program by running the Script
  Executes as its Compiled
  Can be used interactively
Compiled Language
  Cannot execute your source code (.cpp File)
  Sourced code needs to be compiled into an executable
  Cannot be used interactively
  The Executable is the end product

  Rookie Mistake:
    Forgetting to compile and running old executable

Terminal commands are in bash language

For Io objects cin and cout
  must include
  #include (iostream)

  What can be out putted
    any data can be outputted to display screen
      variables
      literals

    int a = 7;
    cout << a;
    cout << "hello";
    cout << 12;

    Basically the equivilant of display in MATLAB

    Cascading : multiple values in one Cout

    cout << numberOfGames << "Games Played";

    cout << "Hello World\n";
    cout << "Hello World" << endl;

Variables and Assignment Statements
  Must declare variables before using
      specify data type ( No Default )

    int a; // declared a as interger type

  Can declare multiple variables of one type, in a single line

    int a, b; // a and b declared as integer types

  Once declared, can assign data to vars

      a = 3; // semicolon IS required
             // If not -> will not compile

  Cannot place value of one type into variable of another

    b = 3.2 // only 3 will be assigned to b

  More on type casting later


Variable types
  int
  long int
  double
  char
  bool

Arithmatic Operators
  +
  -
  *
  /
  % (Modulo)

  no ^ operator - will need to use POW in the cmath library include (cmath)

  int a = 1, b = 2;
  double x;
  x = a/b;

  result is 0 because you are trying to divide two integers
  a and b should be Double or float types

  cout << 17/5 << endl // What will be displayed

    due to automatic typecasting they are int itll just display 3
