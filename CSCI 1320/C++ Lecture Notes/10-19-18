  Matlab
    Scripting Language
    No compiler
  C++
    Compiled Language
    Turns it into an executable file - that is actually run on our program
      No longer contains our written code. It is a very efficient machine Language
      (Not Human Readable)
    Not very easy to reverse engineer from executable to origional code.

Getting started
  Two Essentials
    Editor to create source files (.cpp)
