4 Different incremental algorithms

Statically Defined Arrays
  Need loops to copy, element wise
  Indices start at 0
  Cannot grow arrays dynamically
    int myArray[4];
    myArray[5] = 12;; // THIS DOES NOT WORK

  Use a for loop
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
      cout << myArray[i];

--- arrayEg.cpp ---

Arrays as function arguments
  functions can be defined to take in arrays as an argument.
    Works much differently than vectors in MATLAB
    A pass-by-array parameter behaves like a pass-by-reference
    The ADDRESS of the first array element is what's actually getting passed.

    ex:
      void foo(int myArray[],int size); // The function doesn't actually know where the array ends w/o the size

    Theres no need to return arrays because we are directly editing where they are stored
    Actually CANNOT return arrays
